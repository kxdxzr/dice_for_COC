## Function
There are several commonly used dice involved including 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, 1d100.

Manully dice calculation is the button entry which takes in a format like 1d3 + 2d6 + 2

If you have two screen, the second window can be used to show the results and hide all the hidden dicing.

The biggest window is used to keep record of all the dice you have done, when the function is closed by the "exit" button, it will be automaticly be saved into a log file.

The color of the result will change when 1d100 > 95 or < 5 for the indication of Fumbles and Criticals.


## Further
Still in developing and glad to solve bugs anyone raised.

PC name entry will be done later.

Fumbles and Criticals range will be available to be set.

## Current bugs:
Won't handle error input in manual dice.

Some import packages are not used.
